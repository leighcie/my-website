            <h2>Project Case Study: Redesigning the Renewals Process for the State Insurance Marketplace</h2>
            <h3><!--subheader here--></h3>
            <p>Overview: I spearheaded the overhaul of the renewals process for the state insurance marketplace to enhance efficiency and user experience.</p>
        
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Context: the renewals process required manual initiation and continuous monitoring, leading to substantial system downtimesâ€”typically exceeding 8 calendar days.</p>
            <p>Specific Problems: We aimed to automate and expedite the renewals process to identify eligible customers, verify their eligibility, offer automatic and option-based renewal system while minimizing downtime.</p>
        
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Approach: We mapped out existing processes and pain points, then evaluated our newly designed service-oriented architecture for enhancements.</p>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducted a detailed analysis of the manual process.</li>
                <li>Mapped the current workflow and pinpointed inefficiencies.</li>
                <li>Designed an automated solution leveraging our enhanced service-oriented architecture.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with stakeholders to gather requirements and align on goals.</li>
                <li>Developed, tested, and implemented the new process in an AWS environment.</li>
                <li>Monitored and refined the solution post-implementation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Technologies and Tools: Agile methodologies (Scrum), service-oriented architecture, AWS, Java, Spring Boot, Jira (work management), Confluence (documentation), PowerPoint (presentations), Miro (process mapping), Slack (team collaboration).</p>
        
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Outcomes: The new automated process successfully processed 87% of renewals within 24 hours.</p>
            <p>KPIs: We set a goal to process 80% of renewals within 3 days.</p>
            <p>Impact: This significantly reduced downtime, allowing support staff and customers more time to make insurance selections. Despite concerns from a recent data migration, we surpassed our target renewal rate.</p>
        
            <h2>Learnings and Reflections</h2>
            <p>Challenges Faced: The process involved multiple teams, requiring intensive collaboration under tight deadlines. We encountered gaps in requirements and data errors that needed quick resolution.</p>
            <p>Key Learnings: Success relies on shared ownership across teams. Effective collaboration, documentation of edge cases, and streamlined error handling set teams up for future successes.</p>
            <p>Future Improvements: While the project was a success, future efforts could focus on optimizing front-end processes for even greater efficiency.</p>
