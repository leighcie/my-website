      <p>I have 10 years of product experience, the past 2 years within the Healthcare Insurance industry. During that time, I have gained experience by successfully fulfilling multiple roles. I have more than 15 years of experience managing resources, budgets, and projects. I enjoy designing and developing solutions to meet customer needs, business needs, and improve processes. Some of my strengths are in translating technical information to a non-technical audience, data management, and process improvements. I am a passionate individual and strive to make personal improvements that will help me act for both internal and external customers better.</p>
      <p>As someone who suffers from chronic depression, I have no interests or hobbies. I do have 2 cats and a loving fianc√©. My cats are Zebulon and Ajira. They do not like each other.</p>
